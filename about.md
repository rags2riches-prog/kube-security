# We are Kubernetes Specialists at the core

![Kubernetes Specilizations](./assets/images/kube-specs.png)

We are fully certified Kubernetes specialists **(CKA / CKAD / CKS)** with high focus on security.
If you are reading this and are curious, check out some relevant [specializations here](https://www.credly.com/users/vincenzo-tagliavia/badges).

We run independent, cloud-agnostic Kubernetes forensics against vulnerabilities and mis-configurations at different levels of your technology stack.
Our approach to security is methodical, structured and highly iterative (from the host OS to the container workloads and back) to produce a multi-layered secure architecture.

We provide both advisory and high-quality development solutions to secure your cluster and workloads with no lock-in strategies and no strings attached.

## How are we different from the rest?

- We deal with cloud-agnostic technologies and open source software tools; that is:
- No lock-in policies, which means we are not affiliated with SaaS or third-party vendors. Furthermore, this means we are independent and have no conflicts of interests in suggesting specific solutions to you
- We are flexible around your needs and can travel to your offices if required
- No minimum contract requirements 
- No deposits or lump-sum payments to remit in advance
- We offer a FREE initial consultation which often includes cluster-wide forensics (cloud-based managed services may not be supported) and an initial roadmap to security, cost optimization or performance fine-tuning

## Pricing

- Headline Contracting Rate: CHF 850-1500/day
- New Projects Introductory Rate: CHF 500/day (offer exclusively aimed at new clients)
